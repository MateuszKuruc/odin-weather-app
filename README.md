# odin-weather-app

<p>Weather app that allows you to check weather conditions in any place you want.</p>
<h2>Goals</h2>
<p>The aim is to build an app which will handle the data provided by the external API and display the results to the user.</p>
<p>The app is built with JavaScript, HTML and CSS.</p>
<p>This is the first time I used external API to get data from the internet and then handle and display it within the browser. This was a great push for me to learn about asynchronous JavaScript, how to ask for data and receive it, as well as basic error handling.</p>
<h2>Key features</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Search for location and display weather data</li>
  <li>Toggle between Celsius and Fahrenheit degrees for temperature and kilometers vs miles for wind speed</li>
  <li>Basic validation in search bar, display error message if the location does not exist</li>
  <li>Use external API with individual key to handle weather data</li>
</ul>
